# What is Digital-Signals?
A digital signal is a representation of analog data (continuous, varying signals like sound or light) in a discrete, binary form. It is a series of binary values (0s and 1s) that encode information. Digital signals are commonly used in modern technology, such as computers, telecommunications, and digital media, due to their reliability, ease of processing, and resistance to noise and degradation.

The process of converting analog signals into digital form is known as digitization or analog-to-digital conversion (ADC). Digital signals are characterized by discrete levels or quantization levels, where each level corresponds to a specific numerical value. The higher the bit depth (number of bits used to represent each sample), the more accurately the digital signal can approximate the original analog signal.

Digital signals offer advantages like ease of storage, efficient transmission, and the ability to apply various digital processing techniques such as compression, encryption, and error correction. They have become the foundation of modern information technology and communication systems.
