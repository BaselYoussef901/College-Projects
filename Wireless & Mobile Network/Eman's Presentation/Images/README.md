Download these images and put all of them in directory path as follows:
"eDeep\app\src\main\res"
paste the images and restart your android studio and the application should work fine



if the application on first start doesnt work,
comment the part of sliding in Fragment_Home.java and then insert movies first
if there is no movie in the application the application will crash, make sure to add movies by top right menu and add movies 
again if the application crash or exist when u try to open it
go to Fragment_Home.java and comment the part of the sliding images in home and rerun it again (when it rerun and open make sure to add movies 'FULL MOVIES THAT SHOW IN DISPLAY MOVIES')
