# What is Data-Compression?

Data compression is a process of reducing the size of data files or streams to save storage space or transmission bandwidth. It involves encoding information in a more efficient way, so that the compressed data representation requires fewer bits than the original data. This is typically achieved by removing redundancy and irrelevant information from the data.

Compression techniques can be broadly categorized into two types:

Lossless Compression: This method retains all the original data when it's decompressed. It's commonly used for text files, program files, and data where no loss of information is acceptable. Examples of lossless compression algorithms include ZIP, GZIP, and PNG.

Lossy Compression: In this approach, some data is intentionally discarded during compression, which can result in a smaller file size but at the cost of reduced quality. Lossy compression is often used for multimedia files like images, audio, and video. Popular lossy compression algorithms include JPEG (for images) and MP3 (for audio).

Data compression is essential in various applications, such as file storage, data transmission over networks, and multimedia streaming. It helps optimize resource usage and improve data transfer efficiency while minimizing the impact on data quality, depending on the chosen compression method.
